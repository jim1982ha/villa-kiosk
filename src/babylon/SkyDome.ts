// A sun-driven procedural sky so the view through windows reads as real sky/outside
// instead of a flat clear colour. Uses Babylon's atmospheric SkyMaterial driven by
// the same sun direction that lights the scene (SunController), so it tracks the
// villa's latitude/longitude and the time of day: blue by day, warm at dusk, deep
// blue at night. No texture assets required (SweetHome's sky never exports to GLB).
