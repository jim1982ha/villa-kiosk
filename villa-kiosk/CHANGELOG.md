## 2.690.0

### Fixed — dismissing a concern three times now actually silences it, and agent settings are validated
Two halves that never met: the dismissal counter computed the right suppression
list and handed it to the browser, while the gate read a config key nobody ever
wrote — so "stop telling me about the gym lights" was recorded and discarded.
`for_run` now unions the earned list into the run snapshot. Found by walking the
64-requirement catalogue against the code rather than the task ledger, which also
caught `config.errors` being called by nothing: agent settings went through the
generic store handler, so an unlisted `investigate_mode` returned 200 and read as
the wrong one. A new test fails on any public function in `agent/` that only its
own tests call — the shape eight separate defects here have taken.
