# Changelog

## 2.4.4

### Changes
- Overview gestures simplified to an explicit, modifier-gated model:
  - Desktop: plain drag = pan · Shift+drag = rotate + tilt · Ctrl+drag = zoom
  - Mouse wheel / trackpad pinch still zooms (universal map idiom, kept)
  - Touch: 1-finger = pan · 2-finger pinch = zoom · twist = rotate · vertical = tilt
  - Modifier is read per move event, so it can be pressed/released mid-drag
- Overview HUD hint updated to describe the new controls

## 2.4.3

### Changes
- Settings model section now gates on Ingress (add-on) mode, not on whether a path
  happens to be set:
  - In add-on mode the upload / replace / clear buttons are gone entirely — the
    panel shows which files are in use (GLB + SH3D paths read from the add-on config)
  - If model_path is not set in add-on mode, a warning explains how to configure it
  - Standalone / dev deployments keep the full upload UI (unchanged)

## 2.4.2

### Changes
- Overview camera gestures rewritten — Google Earth style (trackpad + touchscreen):
  - Trackpad 2-finger slide → pan (was incorrectly zooming before)
  - Trackpad pinch (ctrlKey) → zoom
  - Shift + scroll → tilt (Y) + rotate heading (X)
  - Touch 1-finger → pan; 2-finger pinch → zoom; 2-finger twist → rotate; 2-finger vertical → tilt
- Add-on model is now exclusive: when model_path is set in the add-on config, the app
  ONLY loads from there (no IndexedDB fallback). Avoids confusion with stale per-browser uploads.
- Clear error message when the add-on model path is unreachable (instead of silent fallback)

## 2.4.1

### Changes
- Central model hosting: set model_path / sh3d_path in the add-on configuration
  page; all clients load the same GLB+SH3D automatically (no per-browser upload)
- nginx serves /model/ from HA www folder; supervisor-proxy exposes /addon-config
- Settings modal shows central model status with a green confirmation banner
- Per-client IndexedDB upload still works as fallback for dev / non-add-on use

## 2.4.0

### Changes
- Bird's-eye overview camera mode: toggle between first-person walk and top-down plan view
- Overview: pan (1 finger/drag), zoom (pinch/wheel), tilt & rotate (2-finger), tap entities to control
- Room grid teleport works in overview mode (pans the bird's-eye camera to the room)
- Entity ID remap in Config Editor: redirect a 3D mesh to a new HA entity without rebuilding the GLB
- Natural scrolling toggle in Settings (overview pan/zoom direction)

## 2.3.4

### Changes
- v4.0: Introducing God mode

---


## 2.3.3

### Changes
- mobile: responsive config table + reliable tap-to-open panel on touch + safe-area insets

---


## 2.3.2

### Changes
- fix floating labels + curtain retraction direction

---


## 2.3.1

### Bug fixes
- **Spawn position** — on first GLB import, the player could spawn near the outer window wall instead of inside the living room. The room calibration now re-runs after auto-detection enriches the entity map, and the player is re-teleported to the correct position.
- **Fan entity label** — the floating state label for fan entities was orbiting across the screen because it was linked to the spinning mesh. Labels are now anchored to a fixed world-space pin and stay stationary regardless of mesh animation.
- **Blue sphere artefact** — placeholder sphere meshes created for light fixtures were included in the interactive highlight layer, appearing as a visible blue glowing ball in the scene. Light entities are now excluded from the outline highlight (they use PointLight + emissive colour instead).
- **Mobile HUD overflow** — all four toolbar buttons are now visible on narrow phone screens (clock and wifi icon hidden on ≤640 px viewports).

---

## 2.3.0

### New features
- **Light entities** — ceiling LED panels and wall switches defined in SweetHome 3D now appear in the navigation space as clickable controls. Tapping a light opens the control panel; active lights glow via a PointLight source.
- **Clickable state labels** — the floating entity labels (camera, fan, sensor…) can now be tapped to open the control panel directly, same as tapping the 3D object.
- **`input_boolean` support** — manually bound input_boolean entities now show a proper on/off toggle panel instead of a blank sensor panel.
- **HUD toolbar** — Bind 3D object, Drop control marker, and Config Editor buttons are now always visible in the top bar, without opening Settings first.

### Config Editor
- Each entity appears exactly once: auto-detected entities in the top table, tap-bound 3D objects in the Bound section — no duplication.
- Inline metadata editing (type, label, room, confirm) directly in the bindings table.
- Entity search dropdown closes on outside click and Escape key.
- Config Editor header stays visible while scrolling (sticky).
- Auto-detected entity settings section moved to the top for clarity.
- Entities whose 3D mesh names match a HA entity ID are now auto-populated in the Config Editor on model load (no manual pre-configuration needed).

### Blender pipeline (v1.3.0)
- Detects SweetHome 3D `<light>` fixture elements (previously only `<pieceOfFurniture>` was scanned).
- Creates placeholder sphere meshes for light fixtures that have no visible 3D geometry in the OBJ export, placed at the centroid of all instances of each entity.
- Fixed sphere coordinate axis mapping so placeholders land at ceiling height rather than floating above the building.

### Bug fixes
- Entities stored with a legacy `sensor` type fallback are automatically upgraded to their correct type (light, switch, input_boolean, etc.) without requiring a config reset.
- Manually bound entities no longer show "Unmapped" as the room label.

---

## 2.2.0

### New features
- **Clear model button** — Settings → 3D model → Clear stored model removes the GLB from browser storage without touching add-on data.

### Changes
- HA URL, token, and Test Connection fields are hidden in Ingress (add-on) mode — only shown in standalone mode.
- Documentation consolidated into a single README.

---

## 2.1.0

### New features
- **Tokenless auth in add-on mode** — the kiosk connects to Home Assistant through the Supervisor proxy without requiring a long-lived access token. Token is only needed in standalone / direct mode.
- **Auto-connect on load** — in Ingress mode the connection starts automatically; the Connect step is skipped in the onboarding wizard.

---

## 2.0.0

- Initial public release as a Home Assistant add-on.
- First-person 3D navigation of a SweetHome 3D villa model.
- Entity tap → control panel for lights, climate, locks, cameras, covers, fans, sensors.
- Room teleport grid, day/night sun cycle, live weather effects.
- Blender pipeline for converting SweetHome 3D OBJ exports to a click-ready GLB.
